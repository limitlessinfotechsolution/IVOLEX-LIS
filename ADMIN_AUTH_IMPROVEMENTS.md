6. `.env.local` - Added Supabase configuration variables

## Environment Configuration
Added the following environment variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key

## Database Schema
The Supabase integration includes the following tables:
- `users` - User accounts with role management
- `products` - Product catalog with detailed specifications
- `orders` - Customer orders
- `order_items` - Individual items within orders
- `audit_logs` - Security audit trail
- `admin_roles` - Role definitions with permissions
- `user_roles` - User-to-role assignments

## Admin Roles
The system supports multiple admin roles with different permission levels:
- `super_admin` - Full access to all features
- `admin` - Access to products, orders, and users
- `support` - Access to orders and users
- `content_manager` - Access to products only

## Testing
Added new test script: `npm run test:supabase` to verify Supabase integration

## Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- Automatic timestamp updates for records
- Session management with Supabase Auth
- Audit logging for admin actions
- Role-based access control

## Implementation Notes
1. The system falls back to localStorage authentication when Supabase is not configured
2. Admin routes are protected and require proper authentication
3. User roles are checked both in the frontend and enforced by database policies
4. The admin panel is completely separated from the main site navigation

## Next Steps
1. Customize admin roles and permissions based on team requirements
2. Implement real-time features using Supabase's real-time capabilities
3. Set up storage for product images and other assets
4. Add additional security measures like two-factor authentication
