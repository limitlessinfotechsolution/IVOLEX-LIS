# Debug Component Removal

To address the issue of the visible debug component, we've made the following changes:

## 1. Removed ScreenRatioTest Component

### src/app/App.jsx
- Removed the import statement for ScreenRatioTest component
- Removed the usage of the ScreenRatioTest component from the JSX

## 2. Deleted Component File

### src/components/common/ScreenRatioTest.jsx
- Deleted the entire file as it was only used for debugging purposes

## Reason for Removal

The ScreenRatioTest component was a debugging tool that displayed:
- Current screen width
- Current screen height
- Screen ratio

This component was added to verify the screen ratio changes but is not necessary for the production version of the application.

## Visual Changes

1. **Before**: A black box with white text was visible in the bottom-right corner of the screen showing screen dimensions
2. **After**: The black box has been removed, creating a cleaner interface

## Technical Details

The changes ensure:
1. No debugging components are visible in the production version
2. All related files and imports have been properly cleaned up
3. No functionality has been affected by the removal
4. The application maintains a clean, professional appearance

These changes create a cleaner user interface that matches modern web design standards.
