## Upgrade Process

### 1. Backup Current State
```bash
# Create a backup branch
git checkout -b dependency-upgrade-backup

# Commit current state
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before dependency upgrades"
```

### 2. Fix Security Vulnerabilities
```bash
npm audit fix --force
```

### 3. Upgrade Critical Dependencies
```bash
# Upgrade Vite, React, and React Router
npm install vite@latest react@latest react-dom@latest react-router-dom@latest

# Upgrade TypeScript types
npm install @types/react@latest @types/react-dom@latest
```

### 4. Test Critical Functionality
- Verify development server starts correctly
- Check that routing works
- Ensure basic components render
- Test authentication flows

### 5. Upgrade Development Dependencies
```bash
# Upgrade testing tools
npm install vitest@latest

# Upgrade build tools
npm install tailwindcss@latest
```

### 6. Upgrade UI Libraries
```bash
npm install framer-motion@latest lucide-react@latest react-hook-form@latest
```

### 7. Upgrade Minor Dependencies
```bash
npm install globals@latest eslint-config-prettier@latest lint-staged@latest
```

### 8. Resolve Compatibility Issues
- Check for breaking changes in release notes
- Update code as needed for new API changes
- Run tests to ensure nothing is broken

### 9. Final Testing
- Run full test suite
- Manual testing of key features
- Verify build process works
- Check production build

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Breaking Changes
1. **React 19** - May have breaking changes, check migration guide
2. **React Router 7** - Major version upgrade, check migration guide
3. **Vite 7** - Major version upgrade, check migration guide
4. **Tailwind CSS 4** - Major version upgrade with significant changes

### Testing Strategy
1. Run existing test suite after each upgrade
2. Manually test key user flows:
   - Authentication (login/register)
   - Navigation
   - Product browsing
   - Cart functionality
   - Checkout process
3. Verify development server works
4. Verify production build works

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Revert to backup branch
2. Upgrade dependencies one by one instead of in batches
3. Consult specific migration guides for breaking changes

## Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Security & Critical): 1-2 hours
- **Phase 2** (Core Dependencies): 2-4 hours
- **Phase 3** (UI Libraries): 2-3 hours
- **Phase 4** (Minor Dependencies): 1-2 hours
- **Testing & Fixes**: 4-8 hours

Total estimated time: 10-19 hours

## Post-Upgrade Tasks

1. Update documentation with new versions
2. Run security audit again to ensure vulnerabilities are resolved
3. Update package-lock.json in version control
4. Test deployment process
5. Monitor application performance
