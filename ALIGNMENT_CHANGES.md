# Navbar Alignment Changes Summary

To properly align the navbar and ensure it spans the full width of the screen, we've made the following changes:

## 1. Main Navbar Alignment

### src/components/navigation/FloatingNavbar.jsx
- Changed the navbar positioning from `left-4 right-4` to `left-0 right-0 px-4`
- This ensures the navbar spans the full width of the screen with proper padding
- Maintained the max-width container for content alignment

## 2. Mobile Menu Alignment

### src/components/navigation/FloatingNavbar.jsx
- Updated the mobile menu positioning from `left-4 right-4` to `left-0 right-0 px-4`
- Added a max-width container (`max-w-7xl mx-auto`) to match the main navbar
- Ensured consistent styling with the main navbar

## Visual Changes

1. **Before**: Navbar had 1rem margins on both left and right sides
2. **After**: Navbar spans full width with 1rem padding on both sides, creating a more modern and aligned appearance

## Technical Details

The changes ensure:
1. Proper alignment with the edges of the screen
2. Consistent padding across all screen sizes
3. Maintained max-width constraints for content
4. Proper alignment of mobile menu with desktop navbar
5. Preserved all existing functionality and animations

These changes create a cleaner, more professional appearance that matches modern web design standards.
