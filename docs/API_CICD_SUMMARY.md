# API & CI/CD Pipeline Implementation Summary

## API Implementation

### Structure
- Created a RESTful API using Express.js
- Organized code with routes and controllers for better maintainability
- Implemented proper error handling and logging
- Added security middleware (helmet, cors, rate limiting)

### Endpoints
1. `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint
2. `GET /api/products` - Get all products
3. `GET /api/products/:id` - Get a specific product by ID
4. `GET /api/enhanced-products` - Get enhanced product data

### Features
- Static file serving for the React frontend
- JSON data serving from existing product files
- Proper HTTP status codes
- CORS support for cross-origin requests
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Security headers with Helmet

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow
Created a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with the following jobs:

1. **Test Job**
   - Runs on multiple Node.js versions (18.x, 20.x)
   - Executes linting, unit tests, and security audits
   - Runs on both push and pull request events

2. **Deploy Frontend Job**
   - Builds and deploys the React frontend to GitHub Pages
   - Only runs on main branch pushes
   - Depends on successful test completion

3. **Deploy API Job**
   - Deploys the API to cloud platforms (example with Vercel)
   - Only runs on main branch pushes
   - Depends on successful test completion

### Docker Support
- Created Dockerfile for containerizing the application
- Created docker-compose.yml for local development with separate services
- Supports both development and production environments

## Client Integration
- Created an API client for easy frontend integration
- Provided example React component using the API client
- Proper error handling and loading states

## Documentation
- Created comprehensive API documentation (API_DOCS.md)
- Updated main README with API information
- Added usage examples and deployment instructions

## Testing
- Created unit tests for API endpoints
- Integrated with existing test scripts
- Added specific test command for API (`npm run test:api`)

## Scripts Added
- `npm run dev:api` - Run API server in development mode
- `npm run start` - Run API server in production mode
- `npm run test:api` - Run API-specific tests

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Ivolex e-commerce platform with a well-structured API, comprehensive CI/CD pipeline, and proper documentation.
