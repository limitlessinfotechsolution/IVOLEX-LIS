# Footer Alignment Fixes

To fix the footer alignment issues and properly position the currency selector, we've made the following changes:

## 1. Moved Currency Selector to Bottom Bar

### src/components/layout/Footer.jsx
- Removed the currency selector from the main grid section of the footer
- Added the currency selector to the bottom bar of the footer
- Modified the currency selector to only show currency (not region) in the footer
- Positioned the currency selector between the copyright and developer information

## 2. Updated Footer Layout

### src/components/layout/Footer.jsx
- Changed the main footer grid from 5 columns to 4 columns (since we removed the currency selector column)
- Maintained proper spacing and alignment of all footer elements
- Ensured the bottom bar elements are properly distributed

## Visual Changes

1. **Before**: 
   - Currency selector was positioned in the main grid area, causing it to appear in the center of the footer
   - Footer had 5 columns in the main grid when not authenticated
   - Currency selector button had center alignment in the main content area

2. **After**: 
   - Currency selector is positioned in the bottom bar of the footer
   - Footer has 4 columns in the main grid when not authenticated
   - Currency selector button is properly aligned with other bottom bar elements

## Technical Details

The changes ensure:
1. Proper positioning of the currency selector in the footer bottom bar
2. Correct grid column count in the main footer area
3. Consistent styling of the currency selector button
4. Proper spacing and alignment of all footer elements
5. Maintained responsive design for all screen sizes

These changes create a cleaner, more professional footer appearance that matches modern web design standards.
