# Footer Position Fixes

To fix the footer positioning issue where it was appearing in the background, we've made the following changes:

## 1. Modified EnhancedHero Component

### src/components/layout/EnhancedHero.jsx
- Changed `min-h-screen` to `h-screen max-h-[1000px]` 
- This prevents the hero section from taking up the entire viewport height
- Added a maximum height to ensure proper sizing on larger screens

## 2. Updated Main Container Structure

### src/app/App.jsx
- Added `flex flex-col` to the main container div
- Added `flex-grow` to the main element
- This ensures proper flexbox layout where the main content grows to fill available space
- The footer is properly positioned at the bottom of the page

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by:
1. The EnhancedHero component using `min-h-screen` which made it take up at least the full viewport height
2. The main container not using proper flexbox layout to position elements
3. The footer being pushed down by the oversized hero section

## Visual Changes

1. **Before**: 
   - Hero section took up full viewport height or more
   - Footer appeared in the background or was pushed down incorrectly
   - Page layout was not properly structured

2. **After**: 
   - Hero section has a fixed height with maximum constraint
   - Footer is properly positioned at the bottom of the page
   - Page layout uses proper flexbox structure

## Technical Details

The changes ensure:
1. Proper stacking order of elements
2. Correct height constraints for the hero section
3. Flexbox layout for proper element positioning
4. Footer always appears at the bottom of the page content
5. Maintained responsive design for all screen sizes

These changes create a cleaner, more professional page structure that matches modern web design standards.
