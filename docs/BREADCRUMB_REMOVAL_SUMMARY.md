# Breadcrumb Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've implemented breadcrumb navigation across several pages in the IVOLEX application to improve user navigation and site hierarchy understanding.

## Pages Updated with Breadcrumbs

1. **About Page** - src/pages/screens/About/AboutScreen.jsx
   - Added breadcrumb: Home / About

2. **Contact Page** - src/pages/screens/Contact/ContactScreen.jsx
   - Added breadcrumb: Home / Contact

3. **Customize Page** - src/pages/screens/Customize/CustomizeScreen.jsx
   - Added breadcrumb: Home / Customize

4. **Login Page** - src/pages/screens/Login/LoginScreen.jsx
   - Added breadcrumb: Home / Sign In

5. **Register Page** - src/pages/screens/Register/RegisterScreen.jsx
   - Added breadcrumb: Home / Create Account

6. **Cart Page** - src/pages/screens/Cart/CartScreen.jsx
   - Added breadcrumb: Home / Cart

## Implementation Details

Each breadcrumb follows this consistent pattern:
```jsx
<nav className="text-sm text-stone-500 mb-6" aria-label="Breadcrumb">
  <Link className="hover:underline focus:underline" to="/">
    Home
  </Link>
  <span className="mx-2">/</span>
  <span className="text-stone-700">{Page Title}</span>
</nav>
```

## Accessibility Features

- Proper aria-label for screen readers
- Underline on hover and focus for better visibility
- Appropriate color contrast for readability
- Consistent spacing and styling

## Note on Existing Breadcrumbs

Pages that already had breadcrumbs (Shop, Product, Category) were left unchanged to maintain consistency.

## If You Don't Want Breadcrumbs

If you prefer not to use breadcrumbs at all, we can remove them from all pages. Please let me know if you'd like me to:
1. Remove breadcrumbs from all pages
2. Keep them on some pages but remove from others
3. Modify their appearance or behavior

Please let me know your preference and I'll adjust accordingly.
