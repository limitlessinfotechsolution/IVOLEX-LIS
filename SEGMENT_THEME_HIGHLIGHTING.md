# Segment Theme Highlighting Implementation

To implement proper segment theme highlighting for the opened tab, we've made the following changes:

## 1. Updated FloatingSegmentSwitcher Component

### src/components/common/SegmentSwitcher.jsx
- Modified the mobile indicator dot to use the segment theme color instead of white
- Ensured the active tab background uses the segment's primary color
- Maintained proper positioning and animation of the indicator

## 2. Updated Pill Variant Segment Switcher

### src/components/common/SegmentSwitcher.jsx
- Modified the pill indicator dot to use the segment theme color instead of white
- Ensured the active pill background uses the segment's primary color
- Maintained proper positioning and animation of the indicator

## 3. Updated Main Tab Segment Switcher

### src/components/common/SegmentSwitcher.jsx
- Modified the active tab indicator line to use the segment theme color instead of default primary
- Ensured the active tab text and border use the segment's primary color
- Maintained proper positioning and animation of the indicator

## Visual Changes

1. **Before**: 
   - Active segment tabs used a default color (white) for indicator dots
   - Active segment tabs didn't properly reflect the segment theme colors
   - Inconsistent coloring across different segment switcher variants

2. **After**: 
   - Active segment tabs now use the segment's primary theme color for indicator dots
   - All segment switcher variants properly reflect the segment theme colors
   - Consistent coloring across all segment switcher implementations

## Technical Details

The changes ensure:
1. Proper use of segment theme colors for active tab indicators
2. Consistent styling across all segment switcher variants (floating, pills, tabs)
3. Maintained animations and transitions for smooth user experience
4. Proper positioning of indicator elements
5. Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

For example:
- When Leather segment is selected, the active tab will be highlighted with Chocolate Brown color
- When Electronics segment is selected, the active tab will be highlighted with Blue color
- When Furniture segment is selected, the active tab will be highlighted with the appropriate Furniture color

These changes create a more cohesive and visually appealing user interface that matches modern web design standards.
