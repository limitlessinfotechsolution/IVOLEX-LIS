# Navbar Alignment Fixes

To fix the navbar positioning issue where it appeared "moved down a bit", we've made the following changes:

## 1. Navbar Positioning Adjustment

### src/components/navigation/FloatingNavbar.jsx
- Changed the navbar positioning from `top-12` (default) and `top-4` (scrolled) to consistently use `top-4`
- This ensures the navbar is positioned correctly at the top of the screen
- Maintained the smooth transition effect when scrolling

## 2. Mobile Menu Positioning

### src/components/navigation/FloatingNavbar.jsx
- Adjusted the mobile menu positioning from `top-28` to `top-20`
- This aligns the mobile menu properly with the adjusted navbar position
- Maintained responsive design and animation effects

## 3. Main Content Padding

### src/app/App.jsx
- Adjusted the main content padding from `pt-32` to `pt-20`
- This ensures proper spacing between the navbar and content
- Maintains visual balance and readability

## Visual Changes

1. **Before**: Navbar was positioned 3rem (top-12) from the top by default, creating a gap
2. **After**: Navbar is consistently positioned 1rem (top-4) from the top, creating a more compact and professional appearance

## Technical Details

The changes ensure:
1. Proper vertical alignment of the navbar
2. Consistent positioning regardless of scroll state
3. Correct spacing between navbar and content
4. Proper alignment of mobile menu with desktop navbar
5. Preserved all existing functionality and animations

These changes create a cleaner, more professional appearance that matches modern web design standards.
