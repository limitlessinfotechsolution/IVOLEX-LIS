# Breadcrumb Removal Confirmation

## Overview
As per your request, I have completely removed all breadcrumb navigation from the IVOLEX application.

## Pages Updated (Breadcrumbs Removed)

1. **About Page** - src/pages/screens/About/AboutScreen.jsx
   - Removed breadcrumb: Home / About

2. **Contact Page** - src/pages/screens/Contact/ContactScreen.jsx
   - Removed breadcrumb: Home / Contact

3. **Customize Page** - src/pages/screens/Customize/CustomizeScreen.jsx
   - Removed breadcrumb: Home / Customize

4. **Login Page** - src/pages/screens/Login/LoginScreen.jsx
   - Removed breadcrumb: Home / Sign In

5. **Register Page** - src/pages/screens/Register/RegisterScreen.jsx
   - Removed breadcrumb: Home / Create Account

6. **Cart Page** - src/pages/screens/Cart/CartScreen.jsx
   - Removed breadcrumb: Home / Cart

## Changes Made

1. Removed the breadcrumb navigation code from each page:
   ```jsx
   <nav className="text-sm text-stone-500 mb-6" aria-label="Breadcrumb">
     <Link className="hover:underline focus:underline" to="/">
       Home
     </Link>
     <span className="mx-2">/</span>
     <span className="text-stone-700">{Page Title}</span>
   </nav>
   ```

2. Removed unused imports (where applicable):
   - Removed unused `Link` import from react-router-dom in AboutScreen.jsx

## Verification

All pages have been updated to remove breadcrumbs and have been checked for syntax errors. The application should now function without any breadcrumb navigation.

## Note

If you decide later that you want to add breadcrumbs back or implement a different navigation pattern, please let me know and I can help with that as well.
